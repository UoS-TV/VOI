# Booking and Use of Technical Facilities

## Overview

The use by FPBE students of the technical facilities of the Department of Music and Media, e.g. its studios, edit rooms, and portable equipment, are subject to the following conditions.

Students may **only** use the department’s facilities if one or more of the following conditions are met. Note that bookings for coursework will take priority:

1. The intention of the booking is for coursework.
2. The student needs to gain experience in the use of particular pieces of equipment.
3. An arrangement has been made to collaborate with other students or academic departments of the university, with the approval and oversight of the FVPT staff.
4. Special permission has been obtained, in advance, from the Programme Director.

### Safe working

The PATS edit rooms and AC studios and edit rooms do not currently have security cameras, so you must follow the rules for lone working in these areas, especially late at night or at weekends. You should not be alone for long periods at these times, and security should be aware of your presence. Make sure you have an assistant with you at all times in these rooms, or, if this isn’t possible or appropriate, make sure a student colleague knows you are there and be sure to check on each other at regular intervals.

For location filming, follow the guidance given in lectures. In particular make sure there are sufficient people to ensure safety of equipment and people. This would usually mean at least 3 people per camera if this in a public location.

### Electrical equipment

With the exception of laptop and phone chargers, students may not bring any mains-powered equipment which they own, or which is loaned to them, onto the department's premises; all mains-powered equipment used in any of the department’s areas must belong to, or be hired to, the university or a visiting artist. The only exception to this is if such equipment is being used in an official departmental event and has the sanction of the programme director or safety rep. Under these circumstances it must be **tested by a technician** before each use.

### Movement of equipment

The only equipment which may be moved about within the department is that which is borrowed from the technical store. All other equipment, whether installed or not, is not to be moved from the area to which it has been allocated. In the past, serious damage has been done to equipment, and injury caused to people, by inappropriate handling techniques. Disciplinary action may result if this condition is ignored.

Please note that you may only use the department's equipment on the department's premises, or at a bona fide location venue, as specified on the risk assessment before the booking; you may not store or use the equipment in any place other that one where it will be used for officially sanctioned purposes. Failure to comply with this will invalidate the department's insurance, and may be a criminal offence. See later for transporting equipment in your own car.

### Non-academic usage

Furthermore, the department's facilities must **not** be used for non-academic ventures **of any kind** (whether or not they are commercial) without the prior written consent of the university. This includes original acquisition, editing, mastering, post production, processing, the making of copies, or the transfer of any media, whether recorded within the department or not, from any format to any other, if any commercial use has been made, or will be made at any time in the future, of the recording or copy. This will apply whether any payments are made to the student or not. Some items of equipment now owned by the department have been supplied by manufacturers on the understanding that they are for educational use only; these facilities will only be available for letting commercially under strictly controlled conditions.

### Copyright

To this end, the university retains the copyright in the recording of anything recorded by you using its facilities when you have not been charged for their use. No rushes or edited masters (including (but not limited to) CD, DVD, or computer files of any format on any media), clones or copies of such tapes, disks or files, may therefore be released, given, lent, or sold to anyone outside the department without the prior consent of the programme director. Please note that this applies to all media, whether concerts, degree recitals, coursework, or films you have organised yourself. Please also remember that relevant consent forms should be arranged for everything you film.

In cases where original copyright material is being filmed or recorded, the following should be made clear, before every shoot, to anyone you film or record using departmental facilities or equipment:

**_Either_**

The department won’t charge the originating artists, in which case you must only provide a "viewing copy", (generally a QuickTime file) and must also arrange for the appropriate consent forms and abide by the conditions outlined therein. You must retain the master on behalf of the university. Under these circumstances there will be no charge for the use of facilities. You may not charge for your time or expertise.

**_Or_**

The department may be able to offer a commercial operation at commercially competitive prices. Due to limitations on the commercial use that the department may make of its equipment (because of agreements with certain manufacturers) this option will not always be possible, and must be negotiated in advance through the department. Alternatively, provided that the bookings are made by a second- or final-year undergraduate within the degree course itself, the department may agree a special rate which is normally 50% cheaper than the usual rates for external customers; this must be agreed in advance.

### Promotional purposes

We realise that it's to your (and our) advantage that you can show off your skills by developing an online showreel. For this reason, students are granted a licence by the University for **your own work** , as long as the following credit is included:

_Recorded as part of the Film Production and Broadcast Engineering course at the University of Surrey._

Note that this licence **only covers the copyright of the recorded artefact**. It is up to the you to deal with the other copyright holders where necessary (e.g. the writers / performer(s) / the composer / arranger / etc.).

Also note that this does **not** permit sharing of films made by others, or films of departmental events.

### Smoking, eating, drinking

Please note that the law prohibits smoking in all areas of the department, **including the vans**. This smoking ban applies to all users (staff, students and their guests/friends/visitors), and must be enforced by any student in charge of an activity taking place on the department's premises. Similarly, **strictly** no eating or drinking is allowed in **any** technical area. This includes studio control rooms and floors, edit rooms, audio/electronics labs, LTC, and computer labs.

### Loading and unloading vehicles

Vehicles (except for the departmental van) may only wait in the loading bay whilst they are being loaded or unloaded. When unloading is complete, they must be moved to one of the University’s car parks, and brought back to the building when they are to be loaded. University Security has a policy of clamping vehicles (other than the department's van) left in the loading bay.

## Booking Facilities

Bookings of the Department of Music and Media’s technical facilities and equipment are made via the online booking system, SiSo. Within this system, you can make bookings or view existing bookings for facilities for which you have appropriate permissions. See the [DMM Booking Quick-Start Guide](https://surreyac.sharepoint.com/sites/msteams_36c291/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fmsteams%5F36c291%2FShared%20Documents%2FLinked%20guides%2FBooking%20system%2FDMM%20booking%20quickstart%20guide%20v2%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Fmsteams%5F36c291%2FShared%20Documents%2FLinked%20guides%2FBooking%20system&p=true&ga=1) for registration and further guidance on how to make a booking.

Please note that the online booking system only reserves facilities for your use, it does not give you permission to borrow the equipment; this permission must be obtained by completing the checkout process at the time of booking. The equipment is only available to book once the relevant health and safety assignment has been passed. Cameras and lights need appropriate risk assessments submitted in advance.

The use of technical areas for official teaching purposes takes precedence over all other uses. Apart from this the booking system is a "first come, first served" one, so planning well ahead is advised. It is, however, prudent to check that there are no "official" bookings missing before you make firm arrangements for your own sessions.

### Length of bookings

Filming equipment has a usual maximum booking length of 3 days. Longer booking periods for larger projects can be arranged by request from the module leader or programme director.

### General principles for making bookings

The booking system works well when all participants are considerate of each other. To this end, the following guidelines apply:

- Plan your needs well in advance!
- Follow all guidance on bookings, risk assessments, safety and consent forms given in lectures.
- Only book what you need for the time period you need it.
  - Don't make defensive or greedy bookings.
- When making a booking, try to butt this up to other pre-existing bookings.
  - A spare hour between between bookings is likely to be wasted.
- If you need to make a booking and there is scarce equipment left unbooked, talk to the people who have already made bookings.
  - If you've already made a booking, think about whether you need everything you have booked, sometimes a small compromise can satisfy everyone.
- Studios and edit rooms must be returned to brochure-ready condition before the end of your booked time.
- Be excellent to each other. Then we'll all be happy.

### Use of the Sony F5 and F55 cameras

We are in the lucky position of having two F5 and one F55 cameras available to second and final years, with a selection of high end lenses. These cameras are intended for single camera cinematography, and not for multi-camera event coverage. The Panasonic AG-UX180 cameras are far more suitable for multi-camera use. To this end you may only book one of the F55 or F cameras at one time, unless you have permission in advance from the programme director or their representative. Full details of the shoot will need to be submitted before the booking is approved.

### Hard drive loan

The department has rugged hard drives available for long term loan. Please ask at stores if you would like to borrow one of these. You will be required to either return or return and rebook these at the end of the year. Second year students going on placement, and all final year students must return these. Loss of these drives will be chargeable.

### Non-attendance for edit room bookings

Following feedback from programme reps, it was felt that there was a need for a mechanism for being able to formally make use of an edit room where the individual who has booked it is not present within a reasonable time. It was decided that if the booker of an edit room is not present with 15 minutes of the start of a booking, another student may use the remainder of that hour.

### Equipment loan process

Equipment booked on the booking system should be collected from stores during stores opening hours. The equipment will be checked out to you by a technician, and, if required a transit key will be loaned to you. Keep the transit store tidy and maximise the use of space as much as you can.

Please check the equipment is all present at the time of booking, and in particular make sure you have sufficient charged batteries and recordable media. It is recommend that you test and set up everything well before the shoot time. If there are multiple bookings over the weekend, you should make your own arrangements for equipment hand over, and make sure any media cards are available and batteries are charged for the next user. NOTE: that we have multiple quantities of certain items. They are all numbered, so make sure you **take the correct item** when collecting from the portal.

You must return the equipment in person at the end of the booking, unless previously arranged with the stores technician. Any damage to the equipment should be pointed out to the technician. Only negligent loss and damage is chargeable, but if you have negligently damaged or lost equipment, you may be required to repay the cost of repairs or replacement. Please note that the equipment remains your responsibility until it is returned in person to the stores technician. In the case of multiple bookings, the cost of damage or loss may be shared if no one admits responsibility. It is recommended that students have their own hand-over process, where the equipment is checked as OK and signed for.

## Student Booking and Use of the Vans

The unsupervised use of the vans for location filming and recordings is a privilege and not a right. There have been a number of insurance claims relating to damage caused by students whilst a van was on loan to them. £1,500-worth of damage was caused to the engine of one of our vans when it was driven through deep water. Please remember that a diesel vehicle can be seriously damaged by thoughtless driving. A location risk assessment must be undertaken, and this must be approved before you can borrow the keys to a van.

### Use of vans by FVPT students

The vans were initially bought for the sole use of Tonmeister students, however an agreement has been reached to allow use by FVPT students, with minimal impact on Tonmeister use. For use from **Monday to Thursday inclusive, final year FVPT students may book the vans in advance**. Weekend use has always been busier for concerts, so for weekend use, FVPT students must **turn up and book at stores in person on Friday** if a van is free for that weekend. All bookings are subject to driver approval, a van test and the general regulations below.

### Driver approval

A student may drive (though not necessarily book) a Departmental van, provided that he or she:

1. holds a full (not provisional) clean driving licence (i.e. one with no un-spent convictions – if you have any un-spent convictions on your licence, you need to consult the Programme Director before driving a Departmental van);
2. has completed the driver approval process shown below;

3. has passed the Department's driving test (it is therefore sensible to take the Departmental test as soon as possible, whether you expect to use a van extensively or not); and a) is shown as the driver or co-driver on a current Van Loan Form.

A student who has not yet passed the Department's test, may still drive a Departmental van provided that he or she:

1. holds a full (not provisional) clean driving licence (i.e. one with no un-spent convictions);
2. has completed the driver approval process shown below;
3. is shown as co-driver on a current Vehicle Loan Form;
4. has the specific approval of a Department Technician; and
5. is accompanied at all times by a student who has passed the Department's driving test and who takes responsibility for them in the same way that a qualified driver takes responsibility for a learner driver on public roads.

The driver approval process is as follows.

1. To request the Driver Self-Declaration form, please email DMM Stores (<m10059@surrey.ac.uk>).
2. Complete the PDF form and email it back to DMM Stores for approval.
3. Stores will email the approved form to the University’s licence checking dept. – this will start the process for the DVLA check.
4. Once you have submitted your form you will receive an invite to meet with the University Fleet Coordinator to have your licence checked. Your licence will be scanned, permission is then authorised by a unique pin code sent to your mobile phone, once set up this will give permission for 3 years unless withdrawn/removed earlier. All forms will be then held with the designated HR Manager/Officer for the Faculty/Department.
5. When permission has been granted please register for a van test using the sign-up sheet on
the door of PA16.

<!-- ### Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic restrictions

The following restrictions and recommendations for van use are in place in times of pandemic.

1. Only two people are allowed in the van and the middle seat must not be used
2. Masks must be worn if students are in different households
3. Open the windows slightly for extra ventilation
4. Before and after using the vehicle (department van or own vehicle) all touch points must be wiped down with antibacterial spray or wipes (door handles, steering wheel, gear stick, handbrake, control switches, fuel cap). -->

### General Regulations

The following rules are designed to protect the interests of all users, by regulating the loan of the vans, and to comply with the University’s Health and Safety Policy for vehicle use. Failure to comply with any of these rules may not only result in your privileges being withdrawn, but may also breach the terms of the vehicle insurance, and therefore be illegal.

1. A van may only be booked for authorised journeys i.e. for the transport of equipment and 2 or 3 people (including the driver) to a location recording venue ( **NOTE** : See Pandemic restrictions above). Only members of the Department may be a passenger in a Departmental van. No passengers may be carried in the back of a van. It is a breach of the insurance conditions for students to use a van for any purpose not authorised by the University (see earlier); uses other than location filming will only be authorised by the Programme Director under individual, exceptional circumstances, for which prior approval must be obtained.
2. The Department will pay the cost of fuel and other running costs (e.g. oil). The Department will make no charge for journeys whose individual "round trip" distance is 150 miles or less. Beyond this distance students will be charged a mileage rate equal to the University mileage rate. Provided permission is granted before the journey is undertaken this mileage charge may be waived by the Programme Director, but this will only be considered if the recording is of particular importance to your training (and under these conditions you may be asked to meet the extra fuel costs yourself); such permission will not be given routinely. There is, however, no limit to the number of individual journeys (each under 150 miles) that an eligible student can make. PhD students should consult their supervisor, who will negotiate on their behalf regarding journey distances.
3. If possible, there should always be two drivers, qualified as above, with the van for each booking; at least one, and preferably both of the drivers must have passed the Department's driving test. If a student is eligible to book a van but cannot drive, the Borrower (the student in question) need not be the driver. The names of both students (Borrower, and Driver) must appear on the loan form. Under normal circumstances, of course, the Borrower and the Driver will be the same person. The Borrower is the person who will be held responsible in the first instance for the safe keeping of the vehicle and equipment. The driver of the vehicle is legally responsible for the vehicle, basic safety and maintenance checks as specified on the Vehicle Loan Form, and the safe and legal operation of the vehicle.
4. Permission to take a van must be obtained via the Department Vehicle Manager using the Vehicle Loan Form. The Driver specified on the form must be a member of the FVPT or Institute of Sound Recording, hold a full (not provisional), clean driving licence (i.e. one with no un-spent convictions) and must have passed the Department's Driving Test; the Borrower and the Driver will normally be the same person. The Co-Driver must be a member of the Institute of Sound Recording, hold a full (not provisional), clean driving licence and should preferably have passed the Department's driving test; if the borrower cannot drive, there will not be a co-driver. The booking should also be entered on the booking system, so that everyone else can see when the vans are booked. This system will allow you to reserve a van outside office hours, and to trace the holder of the keys after office hours should this be necessary. You should collect the keys from the Technical Store during its opening hours.
5. The maximum loan period is 3 days. The booking system will only allow a booking for a maximum period of 16 hours however, as driving at the end of a long working day could be dangerous. If you require a longer booking, speak to the Stores Technician or Programme Director, who will assess the risk of your booking and advise accordingly.
6. University vehicles are covered by the Allstar breakdown recovery service. The procedure in the event of breakdown and the relevant contact details are shown on the Vehicle Loan Form. Please make sure that Allstar recover the van and return it to the PATS driveway so that you are able to store the equipment securely in PATS.
7. After a booking, the van must always be left with its fuel tank full. The vans are provided with Allstar fuel cards to be used to pay for fuel – these are accepted at the Shell garage on Ladymead (near Burger King). You may need to inform them of the van mileage when you pay with the Allstar card. The process is as simple as swiping the card in the card reader. No excuses will be accepted for a van being left with its fuel tank other than full! Please remember that the vans run on diesel. If you put anything other than diesel in the tank then do not attempt to start the van and instead call for breakdown assistance using the instructions on the van form. It is likely that we will charge the Driver for the costs of draining and refilling the fuel tank.
8. Upon return the equipment must be unloaded immediately; no equipment is to be left in either vehicle over night when they are parked on campus. After office hours the equipment must be unloaded into the transit store.
9. The vans must NOT be parked anywhere on campus except in the PATS loading bay. If it is necessary to stop elsewhere for a short time for loading or unloading, first obtain permission from the University Security Office.
10. The only expenses normally payable (for which a receipt is required) are diesel fuel, oil and other running costs. Parking, congestion zone charges, fines, snacks, concert tickets, facilities fees, etc are your own responsibility.
11. As the vehicles are registered to the department, any notifications of fines (e.g. non-payment of congestion charges, speeding camera fines, parking fines, etc) are sent to the department. If there is sufficient time, we will notify the Borrower of the fine, and give a fixed time within which the fine should be paid. If the fine is not paid within this time, the Department Vehicle Manager will arrange for the fine to be paid, and will recoup this cost, plus an appropriate Administration Fee, from the Borrower. Please note that we are legally bound to notify authorities of the name and contact details of the Driver, if requested.
12. It is illegal to smoke in the vans. It is the Borrowers’ responsibility to enforce this.

### Departmental Driving Test

Any student of the FVPT degree or the Institute of Sound Recording may take the Department's driving test and then be eligible, subject to the rules above, to drive a Departmental van. Therefore, you should arrange with the Department Vehicle Manager to take the test as soon as possible. During the test you will be asked to produce your driving licence (including the digital counterpart licence found here: <https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence>) and may be required to demonstrate your knowledge of the Highway Code, your ability to drive the van safely, and your knowledge of its dimensions, tyre pressures etc. Please ensure that you have completed the driver approval form and have ready all parts of your driving licence before arriving at the department for your test. The cost of your first test will be borne by the Department; if you fail and need to be re-tested you may be charged for the re-test.

## Using your own car to transport Department of Music and Media property

To ensure that the insurance cover is not invalidated, you may only put the department's property in a vehicle other than the department's vans under the following conditions:

1. You must be taking the equipment/property to a bona fide location, i.e. the recording must be needed for coursework, or university business; this means that a recording or filmed acquisition must result from the journey.
2. The journey must be specifically authorised, in advance, by the stores technician, who will explain the extra conditions you will need to meet.
3. You will need to have completed Section 1 of the University’s Driver Approval Form (available from the University’s Health and Safety web pages) and have taken this, together with evidence of business insurance, to the Department Vehicle Manager and had section 2 completed by him/her.
4. You must receive no remuneration (not even expenses) for the recording or shoot.
5. You must state on the risk assessment that you will be using your own car, and must quote its registration number.
6. You (not just the policyholder if this is a different person) must be insured to use the vehicle for journeys connected with the business of your employer. There is normally no extra charge for this, but if you do not have it your whole car insurance may be invalid.
7. You may not leave the equipment unattended in your car. If, in exceptional circumstances, you cannot avoid this, then the equipment must be out of sight, and the vehicle must be locked, even if it is going to be left unattended for only a matter of seconds.
