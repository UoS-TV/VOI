# Use of Technical Facilities

## Overview

The use by FPBE students of the technical facilities of the Department of Music and Media, e.g. its studios, edit rooms, and portable equipment, are subject to the following conditions.

Students may **only** use the department’s facilities if one or more of the following conditions are met. Note that bookings for coursework will take priority:

1. The intention of the booking is for coursework.
2. The student needs to gain experience in the use of particular pieces of equipment.
3. An arrangement has been made to collaborate with other students or academic departments of the university, with the approval and oversight of FPBE staff.
4. Special permission has been obtained, in advance, from the Programme Director.

### Safe working

The PATS edit rooms and AC studios and edit rooms do not currently have security cameras, so you must follow the rules for lone working in these areas, especially late at night or at weekends. You should not be alone for long periods at these times, and security should be aware of your presence. Make sure you have an assistant with you at all times in these rooms, or, if this isn’t possible or appropriate, make sure a student colleague knows you are there and be sure to check on each other at regular intervals.

For location filming, follow the guidance given in lectures. In particular make sure there are sufficient people to ensure safety of equipment and people. This would usually mean at least 3 people per camera if this in a public location.

### Electrical equipment

With the exception of laptop and phone chargers, students may not bring any mains-powered equipment which they own, or which is loaned to them, onto the department's premises; all mains-powered equipment used in any of the department’s areas must belong to, or be hired to, the university or a visiting artist. The only exception to this is if such equipment is being used in an official departmental event and has the sanction of the programme director or safety rep. Under these circumstances it must be **tested by a technician** before each use.

### Movement of equipment

The only equipment which may be moved about within the department is that which is borrowed from the technical store. All other equipment, whether installed or not, is not to be moved from the area to which it has been allocated. In the past, serious damage has been done to equipment, and injury caused to people, by inappropriate handling techniques. Disciplinary action may result if this condition is ignored.

Please note that you may only use the department's equipment on the department's premises, or at a bona fide location venue, as specified on the risk assessment before the booking; you may not store or use the equipment in any place other that one where it will be used for officially sanctioned purposes. Failure to comply with this will invalidate the department's insurance, and may be a criminal offence. See later for transporting equipment in your own car.

### Non-academic usage

Furthermore, the department's facilities must **not** be used for non-academic ventures **of any kind** (whether or not they are commercial) without the prior written consent of the university. This includes original acquisition, editing, mastering, post production, processing, the making of copies, or the transfer of any media, whether recorded within the department or not, from any format to any other, if any commercial use has been made, or will be made at any time in the future, of the recording or copy. This will apply whether any payments are made to the student or not. Some items of equipment now owned by the department have been supplied by manufacturers on the understanding that they are for educational use only; these facilities will only be available for letting commercially under strictly controlled conditions.

### Copyright

To this end, the university retains the copyright in the recording of anything recorded by you using its facilities when you have not been charged for their use. No rushes or edited masters (including (but not limited to) CD, DVD, or computer files of any format on any media), clones or copies of such tapes, disks or files, may therefore be released, given, lent, or sold to anyone outside the department without the prior consent of the programme director. Please note that this applies to all media, whether concerts, degree recitals, coursework, or films you have organised yourself. Please also remember that relevant consent forms should be arranged for everything you film.

In cases where original copyright material is being filmed or recorded, the following should be made clear, before every shoot, to anyone you film or record using departmental facilities or equipment:

**_Either_**

The department won’t charge the originating artists, in which case you must only provide a "viewing copy", (generally a QuickTime file) and must also arrange for the appropriate consent forms and abide by the conditions outlined therein. You must retain the master on behalf of the university. Under these circumstances there will be no charge for the use of facilities. You may not charge for your time or expertise.

**_Or_**

The department may be able to offer a commercial operation at commercially competitive prices. Due to limitations on the commercial use that the department may make of its equipment (because of agreements with certain manufacturers) this option will not always be possible, and must be negotiated in advance through the department. Alternatively, provided that the bookings are made by a second- or final-year undergraduate within the degree course itself, the department may agree a special rate which is normally 50% cheaper than the usual rates for external customers; this must be agreed in advance.

### Promotional purposes

We realise that it's to your (and our) advantage that you can show off your skills by developing an online showreel. For this reason, students are granted a licence by the University for **your own work** , as long as the following credit is included:

_Recorded as part of the Film Production and Broadcast Engineering course at the University of Surrey._

Note that this licence **only covers the copyright of the recorded artefact**. It is up to the you to deal with the other copyright holders where necessary (e.g. the writers / performer(s) / the composer / arranger / etc.).

Also note that this does **not** permit sharing of films made by others, or films of departmental events.

### Smoking, eating, drinking

Please note that the law prohibits smoking in all areas of the department, **including the vans**. This smoking ban applies to all users (staff, students and their guests/friends/visitors), and must be enforced by any student in charge of an activity taking place on the department's premises. Similarly, **strictly** no eating or drinking is allowed in **any** technical area. This includes studio control rooms and floors, edit rooms, audio/electronics labs, LTC, and computer labs.

### Loading and unloading vehicles

Vehicles (except for the departmental van) may only wait in the loading bay whilst they are being loaded or unloaded. When unloading is complete, they must be moved to one of the University’s car parks, and brought back to the building when they are to be loaded. University Security has a policy of clamping vehicles (other than the department's van) left in the loading bay.
