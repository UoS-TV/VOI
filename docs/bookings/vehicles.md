# Booking and Use of the Vans

The unsupervised use of the vans for location filming and recordings is a privilege and not a right. There have been a number of insurance claims relating to damage caused by students whilst a van was on loan to them. £1,500-worth of damage was caused to the engine of one of our vans when it was driven through deep water. Please remember that a diesel vehicle can be seriously damaged by thoughtless driving. A location risk assessment must be undertaken, and this must be approved before you can borrow the keys to a van.

## Use of vans by FPBE students

The vans were initially bought for the sole use of Tonmeister students, however an agreement has been reached to allow use by FVPT students, with minimal impact on Tonmeister use. For use from **Monday to Thursday inclusive, final year FVPT students may book the vans in advance**. Weekend use has always been busier for concerts, so for weekend use, FVPT students must **turn up and book at stores in person on Friday** if a van is free for that weekend. All bookings are subject to driver approval, a van test and the general regulations below.

### Driver approval

A student may drive (though not necessarily book) a Departmental van, provided that he or she:

1. holds a full (not provisional) clean driving licence (i.e. one with no un-spent convictions – if you have any un-spent convictions on your licence, you need to consult the Programme Director before driving a Departmental van);
2. has completed the driver approval process shown below;

3. has passed the Department's driving test (it is therefore sensible to take the Departmental test as soon as possible, whether you expect to use a van extensively or not); and a) is shown as the driver or co-driver on a current Van Loan Form.

A student who has not yet passed the Department's test, may still drive a Departmental van provided that he or she:

1. holds a full (not provisional) clean driving licence (i.e. one with no un-spent convictions);
2. has completed the driver approval process shown below;
3. is shown as co-driver on a current Vehicle Loan Form;
4. has the specific approval of a Department Technician; and
5. is accompanied at all times by a student who has passed the Department's driving test and who takes responsibility for them in the same way that a qualified driver takes responsibility for a learner driver on public roads.

The driver approval process is as follows.

1. To request the Driver Self-Declaration form, please email DMM Stores (<m10059@surrey.ac.uk>).
2. Complete the PDF form and email it back to DMM Stores for approval.
3. Stores will email the approved form to the University’s licence checking dept. – this will start the process for the DVLA check.
4. Once you have submitted your form you will receive an invite to meet with the University Fleet Coordinator to have your licence checked. Your licence will be scanned, permission is then authorised by a unique pin code sent to your mobile phone, once set up this will give permission for 3 years unless withdrawn/removed earlier. All forms will be then held with the designated HR Manager/Officer for the Faculty/Department.
5. When permission has been granted please register for a van test using the sign-up sheet on
the door of PA16.

<!-- ### Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic restrictions

The following restrictions and recommendations for van use are in place in times of pandemic.

1. Only two people are allowed in the van and the middle seat must not be used
2. Masks must be worn if students are in different households
3. Open the windows slightly for extra ventilation
4. Before and after using the vehicle (department van or own vehicle) all touch points must be wiped down with antibacterial spray or wipes (door handles, steering wheel, gear stick, handbrake, control switches, fuel cap). -->

### General Regulations

The following rules are designed to protect the interests of all users, by regulating the loan of the vans, and to comply with the University’s Health and Safety Policy for vehicle use. Failure to comply with any of these rules may not only result in your privileges being withdrawn, but may also breach the terms of the vehicle insurance, and therefore be illegal.

1. A van may only be booked for authorised journeys i.e. for the transport of equipment and 2 or 3 people (including the driver) to a location recording venue ( **NOTE** : See Pandemic restrictions above). Only members of the Department may be a passenger in a Departmental van. No passengers may be carried in the back of a van. It is a breach of the insurance conditions for students to use a van for any purpose not authorised by the University (see earlier); uses other than location filming will only be authorised by the Programme Director under individual, exceptional circumstances, for which prior approval must be obtained.
2. The Department will pay the cost of fuel and other running costs (e.g. oil). The Department will make no charge for journeys whose individual "round trip" distance is 150 miles or less. Beyond this distance students will be charged a mileage rate equal to the University mileage rate. Provided permission is granted before the journey is undertaken this mileage charge may be waived by the Programme Director, but this will only be considered if the recording is of particular importance to your training (and under these conditions you may be asked to meet the extra fuel costs yourself); such permission will not be given routinely. There is, however, no limit to the number of individual journeys (each under 150 miles) that an eligible student can make. PhD students should consult their supervisor, who will negotiate on their behalf regarding journey distances.
3. If possible, there should always be two drivers, qualified as above, with the van for each booking; at least one, and preferably both of the drivers must have passed the Department's driving test. If a student is eligible to book a van but cannot drive, the Borrower (the student in question) need not be the driver. The names of both students (Borrower, and Driver) must appear on the loan form. Under normal circumstances, of course, the Borrower and the Driver will be the same person. The Borrower is the person who will be held responsible in the first instance for the safe keeping of the vehicle and equipment. The driver of the vehicle is legally responsible for the vehicle, basic safety and maintenance checks as specified on the Vehicle Loan Form, and the safe and legal operation of the vehicle.
4. Permission to take a van must be obtained via the Department Vehicle Manager using the Vehicle Loan Form. The Driver specified on the form must be a member of the FVPT or Institute of Sound Recording, hold a full (not provisional), clean driving licence (i.e. one with no un-spent convictions) and must have passed the Department's Driving Test; the Borrower and the Driver will normally be the same person. The Co-Driver must be a member of the Institute of Sound Recording, hold a full (not provisional), clean driving licence and should preferably have passed the Department's driving test; if the borrower cannot drive, there will not be a co-driver. The booking should also be entered on the booking system, so that everyone else can see when the vans are booked. This system will allow you to reserve a van outside office hours, and to trace the holder of the keys after office hours should this be necessary. You should collect the keys from the Technical Store during its opening hours.
5. The maximum loan period is 3 days. The booking system will only allow a booking for a maximum period of 16 hours however, as driving at the end of a long working day could be dangerous. If you require a longer booking, speak to the Stores Technician or Programme Director, who will assess the risk of your booking and advise accordingly.
6. University vehicles are covered by the Allstar breakdown recovery service. The procedure in the event of breakdown and the relevant contact details are shown on the Vehicle Loan Form. Please make sure that Allstar recover the van and return it to the PATS driveway so that you are able to store the equipment securely in PATS.
7. After a booking, the van must always be left with its fuel tank full. The vans are provided with Allstar fuel cards to be used to pay for fuel – these are accepted at the Shell garage on Ladymead (near Burger King). You may need to inform them of the van mileage when you pay with the Allstar card. The process is as simple as swiping the card in the card reader. No excuses will be accepted for a van being left with its fuel tank other than full! Please remember that the vans run on diesel. If you put anything other than diesel in the tank then do not attempt to start the van and instead call for breakdown assistance using the instructions on the van form. It is likely that we will charge the Driver for the costs of draining and refilling the fuel tank.
8. Upon return the equipment must be unloaded immediately; no equipment is to be left in either vehicle over night when they are parked on campus. After office hours the equipment must be unloaded into the transit store.
9. The vans must NOT be parked anywhere on campus except in the PATS loading bay. If it is necessary to stop elsewhere for a short time for loading or unloading, first obtain permission from the University Security Office.
10. The only expenses normally payable (for which a receipt is required) are diesel fuel, oil and other running costs. Parking, congestion zone charges, fines, snacks, concert tickets, facilities fees, etc are your own responsibility.
11. As the vehicles are registered to the department, any notifications of fines (e.g. non-payment of congestion charges, speeding camera fines, parking fines, etc) are sent to the department. If there is sufficient time, we will notify the Borrower of the fine, and give a fixed time within which the fine should be paid. If the fine is not paid within this time, the Department Vehicle Manager will arrange for the fine to be paid, and will recoup this cost, plus an appropriate Administration Fee, from the Borrower. Please note that we are legally bound to notify authorities of the name and contact details of the Driver, if requested.
12. It is illegal to smoke in the vans. It is the Borrowers’ responsibility to enforce this.

### Departmental Driving Test

Any student of the FVPT degree or the Institute of Sound Recording may take the Department's driving test and then be eligible, subject to the rules above, to drive a Departmental van. Therefore, you should arrange with the Department Vehicle Manager to take the test as soon as possible. During the test you will be asked to produce your driving licence (including the digital counterpart licence found here: <https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence>) and may be required to demonstrate your knowledge of the Highway Code, your ability to drive the van safely, and your knowledge of its dimensions, tyre pressures etc. Please ensure that you have completed the driver approval form and have ready all parts of your driving licence before arriving at the department for your test. The cost of your first test will be borne by the Department; if you fail and need to be re-tested you may be charged for the re-test.

## Own Vehicles

If using your own car to transport Department of Music and Media property, to ensure that the insurance cover is not invalidated, you may only put the department's property in a vehicle other than the department's vans under the following conditions:

1. You must be taking the equipment/property to a bona fide location, i.e. the recording must be needed for coursework, or university business; this means that a recording or filmed acquisition must result from the journey.
2. The journey must be specifically authorised, in advance, by the stores technician, who will explain the extra conditions you will need to meet.
3. You will need to have completed Section 1 of the University’s Driver Approval Form (available from the University’s Health and Safety web pages) and have taken this, together with evidence of business insurance, to the Department Vehicle Manager and had section 2 completed by him/her.
4. You must receive no remuneration (not even expenses) for the recording or shoot.
5. You must state on the risk assessment that you will be using your own car, and must quote its registration number.
6. You (not just the policyholder if this is a different person) must be insured to use the vehicle for journeys connected with the business of your employer. There is normally no extra charge for this, but if you do not have it your whole car insurance may be invalid.
7. You may not leave the equipment unattended in your car. If, in exceptional circumstances, you cannot avoid this, then the equipment must be out of sight, and the vehicle must be locked, even if it is going to be left unattended for only a matter of seconds.
