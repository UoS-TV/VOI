To fulfil their responsibilities under the Act, Companies must do \u201ceverything reasonably practicable to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of their employees and those affected by them carrying out their business.\u201d The concept of being reasonably practicable allows the company to consider the time, cost and technical feasibility against the risk faced.</p> <p>The Act also forms the Health and Safety Executive and the Health and Safety Commission, and places other responsibilities on the employer to provide safe equipment, plant, movement and storage of chemicals, safe systems of work, personal protective equipment and to manage the risks within their workplace.</p> <p>Prior to the Act around 1600 people died in the workplace. In 2006/7 that figure was 241 The greatest number of fatalities occur in construction or agriculture. The main cause is from falling from a height.</p> <p>All companies must comply with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 which is part of statute law. Other examples of law can be regulations (delegated legislation) or approved codes of practice \u2013 these are not the law but not to follow them, unless you are doing something better than they require are likely to indicate that you are breaking Statute law. If a company is prosecuted (a prosecution under the Health and Safety at Work Act will be made by the Health and Safety Executive) the penalties can range from fines to imprisonment in certain circumstances.</p> <p>In April 2008 the Corporate Manslaughter act will become law which may make imprisonment of the CEO of a company more likely if it can be established that they have exhibited gross dereliction of safety standards. However the kind of publicity this will attract will also have a detrimental effect on the company\u2019s reputation and may affect their ability to stay in business!</p> <p>The law requires that a company must show that it has put procedures in place to manage safety and provide a safe workplace. That a company may not realise there was a problem would not be excusable. In a Health and Safety prosecution the usual burden of proof is reversed and therefore the company would need to show it has taken appropriate measures, and that its risk assessments are suitable and sufficient for the nature of the risks faced.</p> <p>The intention of safety legislation today is rather than to control processes, there are goals for Health and Safety standards. There are no \u201cSafety while filming\u201d regulations, for instance. There is a general tool applicable to all businesses, which is risk assessment, the aim of which is to analyse risks, and to put in place measures to control them.</p>"},{"location":"Health%20and%20Safety/#safe-use-of-filming-and-related-equipment","title":"Safe Use of Filming and Related Equipment","text":"<p>So before you can use the university\u2019s cameras, lights, sound equipment etc. you must know how to assess the risks involved in using the equipment and put in place appropriate control measures so while you or your team are using the equipment.</p> <p>Risk Assessment</p>"},{"location":"Health%20and%20Safety/#self-study-documents","title":"Self Study Documents","text":"<p>To enable you to accurately assess a hazard and enable you to put an appropriate control measure in place you should read, 5 Steps to Risk Assessment by Health and Safety Executive.</p> <p>The BBC explored many possible dangers while filming so you should also read the relevant extracts from the BBC Safety Documents: https://www.bbc.co.uk/safety/resources/aztopics/</p>"},{"location":"Health%20and%20Safety/risk-assessment/","title":"Risk Assessment","text":""},{"location":"TV%20Studio/","title":"TV Studio","text":"<p>The Television Studio is a state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility that was completed at the start of 2022.

Failure to comply with any of these rules may not only result in your privileges being withdrawn, but may also breach the terms of the vehicle insurance, and therefore be illegal.</p> <ol> <li>A van may only be booked for authorised journeys i.e. for the transport of equipment and 2 or 3 people (including the driver) to a location recording venue ( NOTE : See Pandemic restrictions above). Only members of the Department may be a passenger in a Departmental van. No passengers may be carried in the back of a van. It is a breach of the insurance conditions for students to use a van for any purpose not authorised by the University (see earlier); uses other than location filming will only be authorised by the Programme Director under individual, exceptional circumstances, for which prior approval must be obtained.</li> <li>The Department will pay the cost of fuel and other running costs (e.g. oil). The Department will make no charge for journeys whose individual \"round trip\" distance is 150 miles or less. Beyond this distance students will be charged a mileage rate equal to the University mileage rate. Provided permission is granted before the journey is undertaken this mileage charge may be waived by the Programme Director, but this will only be considered if the recording is of particular importance to your training (and under these conditions you may be asked to meet the extra fuel costs yourself); such permission will not be given routinely. There is, however, no limit to the number of individual journeys (each under 150 miles) that an eligible student can make. PhD students should consult their supervisor, who will negotiate on their behalf regarding journey distances.</li> <li>If possible, there should always be two drivers, qualified as above, with the van for each booking; at least one, and preferably both of the drivers must have passed the Department's driving test. If a student is eligible to book a van but cannot drive, the Borrower (the student in question) need not be the driver. The names of both students (Borrower, and Driver) must appear on the loan form. Under normal circumstances, of course, the Borrower and the Driver will be the same person. The Borrower is the person who will be held responsible in the first instance for the safe keeping of the vehicle and equipment. The driver of the vehicle is legally responsible for the vehicle, basic safety and maintenance checks as specified on the Vehicle Loan Form, and the safe and legal operation of the vehicle.</li> <li>Permission to take a van must be obtained via the Department Vehicle Manager using the Vehicle Loan Form. The Driver specified on the form must be a member of the FVPT or Institute of Sound Recording, hold a full (not provisional), clean driving licence (i.e. one with no un-spent convictions) and must have passed the Department's Driving Test; the Borrower and the Driver will normally be the same person. The Co-Driver must be a member of the Institute of Sound Recording, hold a full (not provisional), clean driving licence and should preferably have passed the Department's driving test; if the borrower cannot drive, there will not be a co-driver. The booking should also be entered on the booking system, so that everyone else can see when the vans are booked. This system will allow you to reserve a van outside office hours, and to trace the holder of the keys after office hours should this be necessary. You should collect the keys from the Technical Store during its opening hours.</li> <li>The maximum loan period is 3 days. The booking system will only allow a booking for a maximum period of 16 hours however, as driving at the end of a long working day could be dangerous. If you require a longer booking, speak to the Stores Technician or Programme Director, who will assess the risk of your booking and advise accordingly.</li> <li>University vehicles are covered by the Allstar breakdown recovery service. The procedure in the event of breakdown and the relevant contact details are shown on the Vehicle Loan Form. Please make sure that Allstar recover the van and return it to the PATS driveway so that you are able to store the equipment securely in PATS.</li> <li>After a booking, the van must always be left with its fuel tank full. The vans are provided with Allstar fuel cards to be used to pay for fuel \u2013 these are accepted at the Shell garage on Ladymead (near Burger King). You may need to inform them of the van mileage when you pay with the Allstar card. The process is as simple as swiping the card in the card reader. No excuses will be accepted for a van being left with its fuel tank other than full! Please remember that the vans run on diesel. If you put anything other than diesel in the tank then do not attempt to start the van and instead call for breakdown assistance using the instructions on the van form. It is likely that we will charge the Driver for the costs of draining and refilling the fuel tank.</li> <li>Upon return the equipment must be unloaded immediately; no equipment is to be left in either vehicle over night when they are parked on campus. After office hours the equipment must be unloaded into the transit store.</li> <li>The vans must NOT be parked anywhere on campus except in the PATS loading bay. If it is necessary to stop elsewhere for a short time for loading or unloading, first obtain permission from the University Security Office.</li> <li>The only expenses normally payable (for which a receipt is required) are diesel fuel, oil and other running costs. Parking, congestion zone charges, fines, snacks, concert tickets, facilities fees, etc are your own responsibility.</li> <li>As the vehicles are registered to the department, any notifications of fines (e.g. non-payment of congestion charges, speeding camera fines, parking fines, etc) are sent to the department. If there is sufficient time, we will notify the Borrower of the fine, and give a fixed time within which the fine should be paid.

Here you can record a guide mono audio onto the camera using a wireless link and record all the mics and mix onto the MixPre-6. Note that this will then require synchronising in post using the timecode, clapper board and audio slate announcement.

NOTE: there are 2 level controls here per channel. The Mic Gain will set the mic level recorded to the track, and the Fader level will set that track's contribution to the LR mix. The 4 knobs on the front of the MixPre-6 can be pressed, and a setting menu will appear. This is called the \"Channel Screen\"</p> <p></p> <p>You can click on the \"1:Ch1\" to name the track. It is conventional to put the Boom first followed by clip/lav mics named with the person's name. NOTE the Wingman app can also be used to name tracks, and this is much easier. These names will remain when imported into editing software.</p> <p>Gain is what you need to set the initial mic gain (input sensitivity). Use the meter to make sure it isn't clipping or so low to be noisy. The lights around the front panel knob will show the sensitivity, or you can use the Wingman app to show all of the levels on meters. You can also swipe on the MixPre-6 meters on the home screen to see all the levels.</p> <p>Set Phantom to on if you are using a phantom powered mic and the Low Cut is useful when recording speech to get rid of air con and traffic rumble and other unwanted sound. Use approx 70Hz for male speech and 140Hz for female speech. NOTE: Radio mic receivers don't require phantom power.</p> <p>You can also turn off the track on another page of this menu (press the 3 dots) - if you aren't using it, you won't end up with a blank track on the file. Arm is very important as it will then record this track when you go into record mode. Note that the recorded signal from a channel is Pre-Fade that means that only the Gain will affect the recorded level and not the Fader. When you are not in Gain mode, the front panel knob will set the Fader level. - this is the contribution level to the stereo mix, which you are recording as guide on the camera and as part of the recorded wav file. The Pan will set the position of this channel in the stereo mix. If you are just using one boom, set this to Centre. If you are using both boom and clip mics on a drama for example, where you will do a full sound edit and mix later, it is conventional to record booms onto L and clips onto R as a guide audio. If you aren't intending to do a full blown sound mix, then you should attempt to match the final mix here as well as you can. Recording individual mics locally though means you have full control later if you need it.</p> <p>NOTE: If you are using only one or two mics for a relatively simple shoot, you can of course simply use the MixPre-6 as a mixer / mic amplifier and record everything onto the camera. This avoids having to resynchronise later. It is still very advantageous to use a separate audio device here, as the production sound mixer can keep a check of levels more easily, and the microphone amplifiers in the MixPre-6 are far superior to the ones in the camera, so you will get a better recording. If you do record the sound as separate files then you should always complete a Sound Report. See later for details on this.</p>"},{"location":"equipment/guides/mixpre6-ux180/#timecode","title":"Timecode","text":"<p>Timecode is somewhat limited on the MixPre6. It can receive timecode from either the mini HDMI port (using Timecode over HDMI - as long as the camera supports it --- this isn't in the HDMI standard), or by using the Aux input mini jack for audio timecode (LTC). You can't output timecode from the Mix-Pre 6. You would need to use the Sound Devices 788T for full timecode features.</p> <p>The Panasonic UX180 cameras support timecode over HDMI. The best way of using this is to set the internal generator in the UX180 to time of day timecode and set it to free run.

This software can also split the multitrack bwav into individual mono files, if the editing system needs this.</p> <p>The MixPre6 doesn't support Scene and Take naming (although WaveAgent does) --- but you can get round this by using the file name / number settings. These can be changed on the MixPre6 itself, or it is easier to use the Wingman App. You can also connect a USB keyboard to the MixPre-6 (see the manual for a handy list of keyboard shortcuts).</p> <p>The file name can be a shortened name of project AND the scene number combined (e.g. PsychoScn3) and then the number can be the take number. You end up with a a file name like PsychoScn3-1.bwav This data will be used when generating the sound report. To name the next take before recording, press and hold the stop button.
