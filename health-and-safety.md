## Health and Safety Background

All companies abide by health and safety schemes for legal, moral and financial imperatives.

### History

- 1802 Safety and Morals of Apprentices Act (first piece of safety legislation passed in the UK)

- 1963 Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act

- 1973 UK joined the European Community

- 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act

### Health and Safety at Work Act 1974

As part of the requirements for entry into the European Economic Community the UK introduced the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. To fulfil their responsibilities under the Act, Companies must do “everything reasonably practicable to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of their employees and those affected by them carrying out their business.” The concept of being reasonably practicable allows the company to consider the time, cost and technical feasibility against the risk faced.

The Act also forms the Health and Safety Executive and the Health and Safety Commission, and places other responsibilities on the employer to provide safe equipment, plant, movement and storage of chemicals, safe systems of work, personal protective equipment and to manage the risks within their workplace.

Prior to the Act around 1600 people died in the workplace. In 2006/7 that figure was 241 The greatest number of fatalities occur in construction or agriculture. The main cause is from **falling from a height**.

All companies must comply with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 which is part of statute law. Other examples of law can be regulations (delegated legislation) or approved codes of practice – these are not the law but not to follow them, unless you are doing something better than they require are likely to indicate that you are breaking Statute law. If a company is prosecuted (a prosecution under the Health and Safety at Work Act will be made by the Health and Safety Executive) the penalties can range from fines to imprisonment in certain circumstances.

In April 2008 the Corporate Manslaughter act will become law which may make imprisonment of the CEO of a company more likely if it can be established that they have exhibited gross dereliction of safety standards. However the kind of publicity this will attract will also have a detrimental effect on the company’s reputation and may affect their ability to stay in business!

The law requires that a company must show that it has put procedures in place to manage safety and provide a safe workplace. That a company may not realise there was a problem would not be excusable. In a Health and Safety prosecution the usual burden of proof is reversed and therefore the company would need to show it has taken appropriate measures, and that its risk assessments are suitable and sufficient for the nature of the risks faced.

The intention of safety legislation today is rather than to control **processes**, there are goals for Health and Safety standards. There are no “Safety while filming” regulations, for instance. There is a general tool applicable to all businesses, which is risk assessment, the aim of which is to analyse risks, and to put in place measures to control them.

## Safe Use of Filming and Related Equipment

So before you can use the university’s video cameras, lights, sound equipment etc you must know how to assess the risks involved in using the equipment and put in place appropriate control measures so while you or your team are using the equipment.

## Self Study Documents

To enable you to accurately assess a hazard and enable you to put an appropriate control measure in place you must read, 5 Steps to Risk Assessment by Health and Safety Executive, 06/06 [http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg163.pdf](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg163.pdf)

The BBC explored many possible dangers while filming so you must also read the relevant extracts from the BBC Safety Documents: <https://www.bbc.co.uk/safety/resources/forms-and-documents.html>
